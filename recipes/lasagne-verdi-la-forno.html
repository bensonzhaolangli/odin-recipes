    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A recipe originating Emilia-Romagna, Italy. This lasagne verde made with
      spinach pasta cannot be beaten. It's excellent if you want to impress
      some guests — or even yourself. It may be a bit time-consuming, but it's
      well worth the TLC you put into it.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>5 ounces spinach - rinsed, stemmed, and dried</li>
      <li>⅝ cup semolina flour</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 cups warm milk</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>1 pint ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 ⅔ cups grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Make Pasta:</b> Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with
        water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil.
        Add spinach, cover, and steam until bright green, about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Squeeze spinach to remove excess moisture and process in a food
        processor to make a paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add semolina, eggs, and salt; process until smooth. Transfer mixture to
        a large bowl and stir in enough flour to make a smooth dough.
      </li>
      <li>Knead briefly, then cover with a dish towel and set aside.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Make Ragu:</b> In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-high
        heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook and stir carrot, celery, onion, and bacon in hot butter until
        onion is translucent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in pork, beef, and ham; cook and stir until crumbly and browned.
        Stir in pork, beef, and ham; cook and stir until crumbly and browned.
      </li>
      <li>Stir in beef stock, tomato paste, and oregano.</li>
      <li>Season with salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        While ragu is simmering, make béchamel: Combine butter and flour in a
        medium saucepan over medium-low heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk to make a roux. Remove from heat, let rest for 1 minute, then
        whisk in warm milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return to heat and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring constantly, until
        thickened.
      </li>
      <li>Season with salt and nutmeg. Remove from heat.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Cook pasta:</b> Prepare an ice bath. Bring a large pot of lightly
        salted water to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        On a floured surface, divide pasta dough into 3 portions. Roll each
        portion out to a thin sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook each pasta sheet in boiling water for 3 minutes; remove and dip in
        ice water; drain and dry on a clean cloth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Finish ragu:</b> Stir chicken livers into simmering sauce. Cook for
        1 minute, remove from heat, and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch
        baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Assemble lasagna:</b> Place 1 pasta sheet in the bottom of the
        prepared baking dish. Spread 1/3 of the ragu, 1/4 of the béchamel, 1/3
        of the ricotta, and 1/4 of the Parmesan over pasta.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat layers twice. Top with remaining béchamel and Parmesan; dot with
        butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, about 30
        minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      These slow cooker brisket tacos are stuffed with flavorful, tender beef
      in a rich tomato sauce. Dress up your tacos any way you like, e.g. with
      shredded Monterey Jack cheese, pickled red onions, diced tomatoes, sour
      cream, chopped fresh cilantro, and lime wedges.

      <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme or 2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chili powder</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, halfed and sliced, divided</li>
      <li>1 poblano pepper, seeds removed and sliced, divided</li>
      <li>3 pounds beef brisket, flat cut; fat trimmed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon lime juice</li>
      <li>24 (6-inch) corn tortillas or taco sized flour tortillas</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Whisk together 2 cups beef broth, enchilada sauce, and tomato paste in
        a 6-quart slow cooker.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in garlic, thyme, bay leaf, chili powder, onion powder, garlic
        powder, cumin, and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place half of the onions and peppers in the slow cooker and set brisket
        on top, fat side up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle remaining onions and peppers over the top. If meat isnâ€™t
        submerged in the cooking liquid, add enough beef broth to just cover
        the meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover and cook until meat is fully cooked and shreds easily, 8 to 10
        hours on Low or 4 to 5 hours on High.
      </li>
      <li>Transfer brisket to a large rimmed baking sheet.</li>
      <li>
        Using a slotted spoon, remove onions and peppers from the cooking
        liquid and set aside in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Skim fat from the cooking liquid and reserve cooking liquid to moisten
        the meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut brisket into 2 to 3-inch chunks, then use 2 forks to shred meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine shredded meat, cooked onions and peppers, lime juice, and
        enough cooking liquid to moisten meat in a serving bowl.
      </li>
      <li>Serve meat in tortillas with desired toppings.</li>
    </ol>
